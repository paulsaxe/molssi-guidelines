Machine Learning Guidelines
***************************

In this section, we provide a general set of recommendations through our curated guidelines that 
might be useful for regimenting routine tasks for performing machine learning (ML) research projects
in computer and molecular sciences (CMSs). These guidelines cover pertinent topics in ML in general, from
data engineering such as file formatting, naming conventions to sharing models in open-access environments
to necessary steps to publish datasets, models and workflows to improve appropriate starategies for data 
management and reproducability of the scientific results.
