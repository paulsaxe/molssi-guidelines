Machine Learning Formatting Guidelines
**************************************
This document presents a set of guidelines and best practices for formatting machine learning (ML) products (e.g., datasets, 
modules, models, etc.) before submitting them on the Zenodo platform and tagging them to one or more curated MolSSI community
collections.

Requirements and Policies
=========================

Prerequisites
-------------
Before getting started, please take a glance at the MolSSI Publishing Guidelines on Zenodo Platform to familiarize yourself with
the basic mechanics and recommended strategies for publishing your software products on Zenodo.

Dataset File Formats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Datasets are tables of data hosting instances (chemical species such as atoms, molecules, macromolecules etc.) in rows and features or descriptors in columns. Each label results from an experimental observation or theoretical calculation and corresponds to a feature. As such, labels are stored at the intersection of each row and column.
We recognize two main conceptual categories for featurizing the input data: (i) geometrical data (e.g., coordinates, connectivities, atomic symbols, etc.), and (ii) chemical features (e.g., energetics, electronic properties etc.).

Geometrical Data
""""""""""""""""
Representation of geometrical data pertinent to individual chemical species such as molecules (or monomers, dimers, polymers, clusters,
unit cells, etc.) is dependent upon the task and adopted ML algorithm. In general, the raw information on individual molecular structures
should be stored as separate files within a subfolder of the root directory called geometries. The recommended file format for storing 
geometrical data is *.mol* which allows for a convenient usage of popular and free chemical data conversion toolkits such as Open Babel.
This representation is probably most useful before training each model since the majority of the ML models require a featurized version 
of these structures into a numerical representation or embedding. The text-based molecular structure representations such as Simplified
Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES) provide an alternative to geometrical coordinates and are comparatively straightforward to be
stored in the dataset tables. SMILES are often precursors for an embedded vector representation of the input structures. Software packages
such as RDKit cheminformatics program and Open Babel toolkit provide modules for the featurization of the SMILES into acceptable 
representations for ML algorithms. These representations, for example, can be based on graph convolutions, physical properties or 
extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs).


Chemical Features
"""""""""""""""""
MolSSI's recommendation for storing the features such as SMILES, energetics or property values is the comma-separated value (CSV)
format. This file should be stored in the root directory of the main dataset repository. This provides a coherent and convenient
way for popular tools such as the Pandas library in python to perform the input/output (I/O) operations and easily convert them
between the popular storage formats such as hierarchical data format (HDF), JSON etc..

Metadata File Formats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
MolSSI encourages all users to carefully record their metadata in a separate `<dataset_name>_meta.csv` file and store it in 
the root directory of the main dataset repository. Each row in the metadata table should correspond to a column label 
[the headline (first) row of the main dataset CSV file] and should at least, describe its type accompanied by a short 
description of what they are referring to. For example, molecular charge is often of integer type and reflects the electrical
charge on the molecule at its ground electronic state in vacuum.

Naming Conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order to make both I/O, query and search operations more convenient, all geometrical files within geometries folder should
be named as `<dataset_name>_<id>.mol` where the name of the dataset in the all-lowercase form is appended by its dataset table
`id` and separated by an underscore. Each `id` is an integer type value located at the first column of the dataset table and 
corresponds to an individual chemical species included in the geometry *.mol* files. For performance reasons, a large number
of geometry files can be batched into separate subfolders of the geometries folder and sorted according to the *geometries/<batch_number>*
naming convention. For the sake of consistency, all file names, feature titles, and labels should be in lowercase.

Data Types
^^^^^^^^^^
Depending on the nature of the data object, both features and labels can assume different data types.

Scalar Quantities
"""""""""""""""""
Numerical-type scalar properties such as molecular charge can be stored as integers or floats with different bit lengths.

Vector Quantities
"""""""""""""""""
By default, the elements of the dense vector quantities such as multiple moments should be stored in separate columns.
For dense vectors of variable length, however, multiple techniques can be adopted. Since the majority of ML models require
the input vectors of the same length, it is possible to find the dimension of the largest vector and pad the other smaller-size
vector instances with zeros. Popular ML frameworks such as TensorFlow provide data preprocessing tools to deal with these cases.
Nevertheless, zero padding wastes the storage resources. In some cases, we might choose to organize such variable length features
in separate <feature>.csv files in the root directory and reflect their descriptions in the <dataset_name>_meta.csv file. MolSSI’s
recommendation, however, is to keep the number of files in the root directory to its minimum.

Another way is to store the vector elements is to serialize the vector to a string or byte representation. The former representation
might not be economical for very large datasets while the latter might be more appropriate for I/O operations via limited bandwidths
over the network.

Higher-order (>1) Tensor Quantities
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Dense matrices and higher dimensional tensors can be flattened to their one dimensional counterparts and treated like vectors.
For sparse matrices and higher dimensional tensors, however, ML frameworks usually provide tools to use the sparsity or manipulate 
the representation such as converting it to a one-hot for classification tasks. There are also libraries that can handle the 
packing/unpacking operations for sparse matrices and tensors such as Armadillo in C++ and scipy.sparse in python.
Should the user decide to use a different approach that is not supported by the existing tools, the details of packing/unpacking
of the tensor elements should be explicitly delineated in the metadata <dataset_name>_meta.csv or Readme.md file in the root 
directory of the main repository. MolSSI recommends the authors to provide scripts or utility modules in order to assist the
data engineering process. The corresponding tools should be placed in the utility subfolder in the root directory.

Non-numerical Quantities
""""""""""""""""""""""""
Non-numerical quantities such as SMILES, by construction, can be stored in the string format for each instance entry and as a separate feature.
